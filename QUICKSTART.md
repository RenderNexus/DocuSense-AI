# 🚀 DocuSense AI - Quick Start Guide

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to DocuSense AI - your smart document analyzer. This guide will walk you through how to get started and make the most of this powerful tool.

## ⚡ What You'll Need

Before we dive in, make sure you have:
- **A web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- **An OpenAI API key** (don't worry, we'll help you get one!)
- **A PDF document** you want to analyze

## 🔑 Getting Your OpenAI API Key

First things first - you'll need an API key to use the AI features. Here's how to get one:

1. **Head to OpenAI Platform**: Go to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. **Sign up or log in**: Create an account if you don't have one
3. **Create a new API key**: Click "Create new secret key"
4. **Copy the key**: It'll look something like `sk-1234567890abcdef...`
5. **Keep it safe**: Store it somewhere secure (but don't worry, we won't save it permanently)

**💡 Pro tip**: The API key is like a credit card for AI services - you only pay for what you use, and it's usually very affordable (a few cents per analysis).

## 🎯 Understanding the Analysis Flow

Here's how DocuSense AI works - think of it as having a smart editor review your documents:

## 🎨 What the Scores Mean

The app uses a 0-100 scoring system with color-coded badges:

- **🟢 90-100 (Green)**: Excellent! You're doing great
- **🔵 80-89 (Blue)**: Good work with room for improvement
- **🟡 70-79 (Yellow)**: Average - some work needed
